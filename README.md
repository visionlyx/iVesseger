# iVesseger
Deep Leaning-Based Interactive Segmentation of Three-Dimensional Blood Vessel Images
As a deep leaning-based interactive vascular segmentation framework, the iVesseger framework employs mouse-click operations to select regions in 3D space, guiding neural networks to correct any erroneous segmentation results. iVesseger comprises four steps: vascular pre-segmentation, interaction point selection, vessel enhancement, and fine iterative segmentation.
